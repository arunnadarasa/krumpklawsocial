BEHIND THE DECISION KRUMP JUDGING RESEARCH BY FREEDOM CITY

Free-DOM foundation is the organization behind the development of the International Freedom City Festival. This international hip-hop celebration (Freedom City Festival) has turned Utrecht into a global hub for street dance over the past eight years. The annual festival represents a commitment to raising awareness of hip-hop culture within and beyond the dance community, encouraging and addressing the broader hip-hop community.

Given Krump's growth within the Utrecht community, researchers were interested in delving deeper into the style to provide educational insights into a form that serves as a catalyst within the hip-hop community. As event organizers in this competitive space, developing qualitative research on Krump judgment aids in promoting fairness in tournament judging.

Over the years, researchers have learned that, due to misinterpretation, street dances such as Krump are stripped of their cultural context, which can be confusing when translated into academic spaces. As a result, it requires decoding the language dancers in this community use to tell their stories and the traditions they carry through movement of raw expression. Therefore, this research represents Free-DOM foundation's effort towards cultural competency, in ensuring that when Krump is spoken of within the community, it is honored and viewed as freedom within motion and expression.

The goal of this research is to collect, summarize, and display the definitions and meanings of Krump terminologies that are used when talking about judging. To connect, a global understanding of qualities and skills is essential for experiencing Krump's mastery. Doing so allows for healthier measures when approaching the deployment of Krump in a competitive setting.

In this document, you'll read:
- Definitions of Krump qualities as the result of conversations and discussions with krumpers worldwide
- Various perspectives on Krump judging, focusing on similarities while respecting the differences
- Food for thought on the most controversial elements of the judging process
- An appendix list of terms commonly used within the Krump community

In conducting this research, highly skilled krumpers provided input on the breakdown and specialization of the dance. These dancers are instructors and innovators in the dance style, specializing in a wide range of skills, making them a credible source. We call them Krump masters.

The information was gathered through 1:1 conversations with Krump masters and panel discussions with dancers from around the world during Behind The Decision programs at four European events and one event hosted in the United States.

## 3. KRUMP BASICS

### 3.1. What is K.R.U.M.P.?

Krump is a raw, expressive street dance born out of South Central Los Angeles in the early 2000s. This style, evolving from clowning, was created by dancers seeking an alternative to gang life through energetic emotional release. Over the past 25 years, Krump exploded onto the global stage, demonstrating intense physicality, power, and authenticity in its movement. The global spread began with the 2005 documentary *RIZE* by Dave LaChapelle. This documentary spotlighted the Clowning & Krump movement in Los Angeles, not only giving insight into their cultures but also highlighting the main actors of this movie: Tommy the Clown, the originator of Clowning, and Tight Eyez and Mijo, originators of Krump.*

K.R.U.M.P. is an acronym for Kingdom Radically Uplifted Mighty Praise. In its early days, Krump's expression was shaped by life's hardships, with dance serving as a way to build brotherhood, express resilience, and rise above difficult circumstances, alongside the praise of God.

As Krump evolved and spread across the world, these foundational values became less central in some contexts, while the quality, intention, and impact of movement gained greater emphasis. Depending on cultural and geographic settings, the original motivations do not always apply in the same way. For many people today, Krump is embraced simply as a dance, valued for its expression, energy, and power in movement.

The culture of Krump goes hand in hand with its community spirit. Dancers gather in sessions and form fams (families) or crews, working as outlets for emotional expression, support, and storytelling. Krumpers showcase their vulnerability through channeling raw emotion and transforming it into movement. The crowd plays a big role in the whole experience, serving as witnesses while exchanging energy with the dancers.

**Note on Origins**: The origins of Krump and who played which roles in its creation has become an important topic of discussion within the community, especially in 2025. While the narrative was once broadly accepted, recent perspectives have challenged this understanding and called for a re-examination of the established story. This research does not seek to intervene in that debate, take a position, or claim authority over the truth. Instead, it aims to present a global perspective on Krump in which multiple narratives coexist. Shared and overlapping elements will be identified as common ground, while differing interpretations will be acknowledged as points of controversy.

**Cultural Codes**: Here is a list of several habits and cultural codes that make Krump the art form it is currently:

- **Hype or Hype Up**: The act of building energy in the cypher. When a dancer "hypes up" the crowd, they are generating excitement and reciprocal energy. Hype is both a noun (the energy level) and a verb (to increase energy).

### 3.2. Krump Tournaments and Competitions

Krump battles have evolved from informal street sessions to organized tournaments with structured judging. The competitive format typically involves:

- **1v1 battles**: Two dancers face off in a series of rounds
- **Cypher battles**: Multiple dancers in a circle, rotating turns
- **Team battles**: Groups of dancers representing crews
- **Judged competitions**: With official judges using defined criteria

The transition from street culture to formal competition requires balancing authenticity with fairness. This research aims to capture the essence of what makes a "good Krump" while developing objective judging standards.

### 3.3. What Does It Mean to Judge Krump?

Judging Krump is not simply scoring technique; it's about evaluating the **quality of expression** and **authenticity of the performance**. A Krump judge must understand:

- The cultural context and history of the dance
- The vocabulary and language of Krump movement
- The balance between technical skill and emotional expression
- The difference between "hype" (energetic performance) and "substance" (meaningful content)

Krump judging is inherently subjective, but this research seeks to identify consistent elements that experienced judges look for across different battlegrounds and cultures.

### 3.4. From Street Culture to Fair Competition: Defining a Good Krump Judge

A good Krump judge embodies multiple qualities:

**Cultural Competence**: Understands Krump's origins, evolution, and community values

**Technical Knowledge**: Recognizes movements, patterns, and skill levels

**Emotional Intelligence**: Can read the emotional content and authenticity of performances

**Impartiality**: Separates personal preference from objective quality

**Experience**: Has danced, battled, or judged Krump extensively

**Communication**: Can articulate decisions and provide constructive feedback

The challenge is maintaining the raw, subjective essence of Krump while creating fair, consistent judging systems.

## 6. NAVIGATING CONTROVERSIAL ELEMENTS

The research highlighted several controversial aspects of Krump judging:

### 6.1. Hype vs Substance

**The tension**: Should judges reward pure energy (hype) or meaningful expression (substance)?

**Consensus**: Both matter. Hype without substance is empty; substance without hype is boring. The best Krump combines explosive energy with authentic content.

**Judging approach**: Look for energy that serves a purpose - that tells a story or expresses genuine emotion.

### 6.2. Personal Style vs Standard Technique

**The tension**: How much should judges reward individual style versus adherence to "correct" technique?

**Consensus**: Style is essential to Krump's culture, but it must be built on solid foundations. rewarding style that clearly demonstrates technical mastery.

**Judging approach**: Evaluate technique first, then originality. A dancer with weak foundations but flashy moves should score lower than someone with solid technique and moderate creativity.

### 6.3. Subjectivity vs Objectivity

**The tension**: Krump is deeply subjective - can we make judging fair?

**Consensus**: Complete objectivity is impossible and undesirable. But consistency across judges can be achieved through:
- Clear criteria definitions
- Judge training and calibration
- Multiple judges to average out individual bias

**Judging approach**: Use multiple judges, discuss scores, and focus on observable elements rather than personal preference.

### 6.4. "Krumping" vs "Acting"

**The tension**: Is the dancer expressing authentic emotion or just performing exaggerated movements?

**Consensus**: Authenticity matters. Krump comes from real experience and emotion. But "acting" is part of performance - the line is blurry.

**Judging approach**: Look for genuine connection. Does the performance feel like the dancer is truly feeling what they're expressing, even if it's theatrical?

### 6.5. Cultural Appropriation vs Appreciation

**The tension**: Can non-BIPOC dancers truly Krump? Should they be judged differently?

**Consensus**: Krump originated in Black communities and carries cultural significance. Respect for the culture is essential. However, the dance itself can be learned and performed by anyone who approaches it with respect and understanding.

**Judging approach**: Evaluate based on quality, not background. But consider whether the dancer demonstrates cultural understanding in their performance.

## 7. CONCLUSION

Krump judging requires balancing several factors:

- **Technical skill** AND **emotional expression**
- **Traditional foundations** AND **personal innovation**
- **Battle dominance** AND **artistic authenticity**
- **Objective criteria** AND **subjective interpretation**

This research provides a framework for understanding what makes "good Krump" while acknowledging that judging will always involve some subjectivity. The key is:

1. **Cultural competence**: Understanding Krump's context and values
2. **Clear criteria**: Using consistent evaluation dimensions
3. **Calibrated judges**: Training judges to apply standards uniformly
4. **Transparency**: Being able to explain decisions
5. **Respect**: Honoring the dance's origins and community
