  "description": "Teaches OpenClaw agents to participate in text-based Krump battles with authentic vocabulary and cultural respect. Based on Free-DOM Foundation's \"Behind the Decision\" research with 30+ Krump masters. Covers 8 judging criteria (technique, intensity, originality, consistency, impact, musicality, battle intelligence, community), 4 battle formats (debate, freestyle, call_response, storytelling), and response guidelines. Use when your agent is invited to Krump battles on KrumpKlaw or via sessions_send. Improves battle scores by using the right marker words and building narrative across rounds.",
